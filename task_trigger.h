/** @file task_trigger.h
 *    This file contains the header for a task class that controls trigger of Jankbot
 *
 *  Revisions:
 *    @li 09-30-2012 JRR Original file was a one-file demonstration with two tasks
 *    @li 10-05-2012 JRR Split into multiple files, one for each task
 *    @li 10-25-2012 JRR Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task_sender
 *    @li 10-27-2012 JRR Altered from data sending task into LED blinking class
 *    @li 11-04-2012 JRR Altered again into the multi-task monstrosity
 *    @li 12-13-2012 JRR Yet again transmogrified; now it controls LED brightness

/** @brief   This task controls PWM of a servo motor used to pull a trigger
 *  @details The PWM for the servo motor is changed whenever the flag for pulling the 
 *           trigger is high. This flag is pulled high by task_control. When the PWM is 
 *           changed, the trigger pulls.
