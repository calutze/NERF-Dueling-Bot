# File:    Makefile for an AVR project
#          The makefile is the standard way to control the compilation and linking of 
#          C/C++ files into an executable file. This makefile is also used to control
#          the downloading of the executable file to the target processor and the 
#          generation of documentation for the project. 
#
# Version:  4-11-2004 JRR Original file
#           6-19-2006 JRR Modified to use AVR-JTAG-ICE for debugging
#          11-21-2008 JRR Added memory locations and removed extras for bootloader
#          11-26-2008 JRR Cleaned up; changed method of choosing programming method
#          11-14-2009 JRR Added make support to put library files into subdirectory
#           9-28-2012 JRR Restructured to work with FreeRTOS subdirectory
#
# Relies   The avr-gcc compiler and avr-libc library
# on:      The avrdude downloader, if downloading through an ISP port
#          AVR-Insight or DDD and avarice, if debugging with the JTAG port
#          Doxygen, for automatic documentation generation

# This define is used to choose the type of programmer from the following options: 
# bsd        - Parallel port in-system (ISP) programmer using SPI interface on AVR
# jtagice    - Serial or USB interface JTAG-ICE mk I clone from ETT or Olimex
# bootloader - Resident program in the AVR which downloads through USB/serial port
# PROG = bsd

# These defines specify the ports to which the downloader device is connected. 
# PPORT is for "bsd" on a parallel port, lpt1 on Windows or /dev/parport0 on Linux.
# JPORT is for "jtagice" on a serial port such as com1 or /dev/ttyS0, or usb-serial 
#       such as com4 or /dev/ttyUSB1, or aliased serial port such as /dev/avrjtag
# BPORT is for "bootloader", the USB/serial port program downloader on the AVR
# The usbtiny programmer doesn't need a port specification; it has a USB identifier
